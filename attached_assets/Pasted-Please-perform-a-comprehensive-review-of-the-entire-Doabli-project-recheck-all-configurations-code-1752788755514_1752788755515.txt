Please perform a comprehensive review of the entire Doabli project, recheck all configurations, code, and setup, and fix any potential bugs or issues that may have been missed. Ensure the following are thoroughly checked and fixed:

WebSocket Connection:

Ensure the WebSocket connection is correctly established using the dynamic URL (not localhost).

Validate that the WebSocket server is listening and responding correctly to client-side requests.

Database Configuration:

Recheck the PostgreSQL database connection and ensure the DATABASE_URL is correctly set in the environment.

Confirm that database migrations are properly applied and data is accessible.

Ensure that the schema is correctly pushed and no issues remain with the database tables.

Session Management and Authentication:

Reverify that the Replit OIDC authentication is correctly configured with the SESSION_SECRET environment variable.

Test the login and logout functionality to ensure the session handling works properly.

Ensure the session is stored and validated across page reloads.

Frontend and Routing:

Verify that all React components are correctly rendering and there are no broken routes or missing imports.

Confirm that useLocation and routing (using react-router-dom or wouter) are functioning properly in the app.

Ensure that dynamic routing is working and that the app behaves as expected when navigating between views.

File Exclusion and .gitignore:

Double-check the .gitignore file to ensure that all unnecessary files, like node_modules, .env, .DS_Store, etc., are excluded from the repository.

Make sure no sensitive files or environment variables are accidentally pushed to GitHub.

Environment Variables:

Ensure that the environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, and others) are set correctly on Replit's Secrets page.

Verify that all required environment variables are loaded correctly by the application.

Error Handling and Logging:

Check that any potential runtime errors are properly handled, and if necessary, an error boundary is used in React to catch errors.

Ensure all logs are clear and informative, especially around the authentication flow and WebSocket connection.

UI and Styling:

Verify that the UI is responsive and that the layout works across devices.

Confirm that styles are applied correctly and that no UI elements are missing or broken.

General Testing:

Conduct a thorough test of the app's functionality, including the login flow, task creation, file uploading, and other key features.

Verify that there are no broken links, missing features, or unsynced data.

Summary of Expected Fixes:

Recheck WebSocket connection handling to ensure the dynamic URL is correctly used.

Fix database connectivity issues if any persist.

Double-check authentication and session management flow for potential bugs.

Verify UI components and routing functionality in React.

Recheck .gitignore for proper file exclusion.

Ensure environment variables and secrets are set correctly in Replit.

Test the app thoroughly and fix any lingering bugs in the process.

Once you've rechecked and fixed all of the above, please confirm and list the changes/fixes made in your response.
